A short Java program is listed below. One block of
the program is missing! Your challenge is to match
the candidate block of code (on the left), with the
output that youâ€™d see if the block were inserted.
Not all the lines of output will be used, and some of
the lines of output might be used more than once.
Draw lines connecting the candidate blocks of
code with their matching command-line output.
