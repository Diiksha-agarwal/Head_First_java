===========================================question===============================================
This chapter explored the wonderful, static world
of Java. Your job is to decide whether each of the
following statements is true or false.

==========================================statements==============================================

1. To use the Math class, the first step is to make an instance of it.
2. You can mark a constructor with the static keyword.
3. Static methods don’t have access to instance variable state of the “this” object.
4. It is good practice to call a static method using a reference variable.
5. Static variables could be used to count the instances of a class.
6. Constructors are called before static variables are initialized.
7. MAX_SIZE would be a good name for a static final variable.
8. A static initializer block runs before a class’s constructor runs.
9. If a class is marked final, all of its methods must be marked final.
10. A final method can be overridden only if its class is extended.
11. There is no wrapper class for boolean primitives.
12. A wrapper is used when you want to treat a primitive like an object.
13. The parseXxx methods always return a String.
14. Formatting classes (which are decoupled from I/O) are in the java.format package.

==========================================answers==================================================
1. False, the Constructor of Math class is private and its methods are static.
2. False, the constructor is used to initialize instance variables so it can't be static.
3. True, static methods can't access any non-static variables.
4. False, though its not illegal but it leads to confusion.
5. True, It is an application.
6. False, It is the other way around.
7. True, It follows the conventional naming convention.
8. True, It runs when the class is loaded,
9. False, its a redundant activity,
10. False, A final method can't be overridden at all.
11. False, The wrapper class for boolean is Boolean.
12. True, Essentially yes.
13. False, the parseXxx methods are to convert it from string to a given type.
14. False, Java.util.
