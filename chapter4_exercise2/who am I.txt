========================================question================================================
A bunch of Java components, in full costume, are playing a party
game, “Who am I?” They give you a clue, and you try to guess who
they are, based on what they say. Assume they always tell the truth
about themselves. If they happen to say something that could be
true for more than one attendee, then write down all for whom that
sentence applies. Fill in the blanks next to the sentence with the
names of one or more attendees.
Tonight’s attendees:
instance variable, argument, return, getter, setter,
encapsulation, public, private, pass by value, method
==================================================================================================
1) A class can have any number of these. : instance variable, method , getter, setter 

2) A method can have only one of these. : return

3) This can be implicitly promoted. : argument,return

4) I prefer my instance variables private. : encapsulation

5) It really means “make a copy.” : pass by value

6) Only setters should update these. : instance variable

7) A method can have many of these. : argument

8) I return something by definition. : getter

9) I shouldn’t be used with instance variables. : public

10) I can have many arguments. : method

11) By definition, I take one argument. : setter

12) These help create encapsulation. : public, private , getter , setter

13) I always fly solo. : return
